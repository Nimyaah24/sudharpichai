                <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
                <p>On the chief executive officer (CEO) of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google.
                    Pichai began his career as a materials engineer. Following a short stint at the management
                    consulting firm McKinsey & Co., Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management
                    and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and
                    ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. In addition, he went on to oversee
                    the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps. In 2010, Pichai also announced
                    the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.
                    The Chromebook was released in 2012. In 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products
                    that he oversaw.

                    Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015, after previously being
                    appointed Product Chief by CEO Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position at
                    the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company
                    family. He was appointed to the Alphabet Board of Directors in 2017.

                    Pichai was included in Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2016 and 2020.</p>
